# DigitizedRhinoplastyJSONParser
A JSON Parser created to work with Dr. Oguzhan Topsakal's Digitized Rhinoplasty for my Masters Project.

To start:

Inside node_express.js, change the server details so that the node server can appropriately connect to your MySQL server.

The server you connect to must have the correct schema (participant, participant_landmark, participant_measurement, landmark, measurement) as well as landmark and measurement data.

Using Command Prompt, Visual Studio Code, or something similar, run the node server (node_express.js).
Open the Statistics.html file in a web browser.
Select participant features, measurements or landmarks, and statistics.
Press submit and view statistic information
